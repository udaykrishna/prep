Bubble Sort
  - for ith elem check sort with i+1th elem to sort order
        - For loop 1: for elem i=0 to i=n-1
        - For loop 2: for i = 0 to i= n-1
  - repeat the above step if i<n
  - OPTIMIZATION: this procedure keeps pushing max elem to the end so second loop esentially has no swaps after n-i-1 steps
